						<p></p><h2>Marcelo Oliveira is a 5th degree Black Belt and former MMA fighter with over 25 years experience teaching authentic Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to adults and children. He is originally from Gracie Barra BH, Minas Gerais, Brazil, and is certified under Vinicius Magalhaes "Draculino”.</h2><p></p> 
						<p>Professor Marcelo first experienced martial arts at the age of 6 years old, encouraged by his older brother Marcus Oliveira, who is also a professional fighter in Brazil. Marcelo studied different martial arts, such as Kung Fu, Karate, Taekendo, Full Contact, Ken Judo and other self-defense systems using guns and knives.</p>
						<p>His experience as an instructor began when he was only 13 years old, teaching secrets of martial arts to children at the Yate Club Pampulha in Belo Horizonte, the same town where later he opened his first school. He also initiated community work with homeless kids from the area.</p>
						<p>In 1988 he earned his black belt in Taekendo under Master Park. One year later he received his black belt in Ken Judo and Full Contact, accomplishing professional open division combats.</p>
						<p>In 1989 Antonio Novares, a professor from Gracie Barra Rio arrived in Belo Horizonte. Marcelo embraced Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as a way to improve his fighting abilities.</p>
						<p>When Vinicius Magalhaes "Draculino” from Gracie Barra Rio established the first Gracie Barra Jiu-Jitsu Academy in Belo Horizonte in 1995, Marcelo became one of his first students and competitors. Later he was also an instructor at Gracie Barra BH, under Draculino's supervision. He won victories at the state and national level.</p>

						<p>The Gracie Barra BH is considered one of the most technical Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu schools in the world. Marcelo moved to United States to continue spreading his knowledge of authentic Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to adults and children. He is considered a Master in special details and modifications of the "Arte Suave" for law enforcement and self-defense training. He invites all of his students to participate in BJJ Camp Seminars in Brazil and activities of self-defense in Tiro Urbano shooting school.</p>
						<p>Currently under Master Renzo Gracie, Marcelo continues working and serving the community.</p>
